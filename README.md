## Setup

### Open in Google Colab

Simply click the badge in each notebook to open it in Google Colab.

### Run locally

The UV lockfile contains the same Python package versions as used in the Google Colab environment
as of October 2025. To set up a local environment with these packages,
[Install UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) and sync the environment with
the lockfile: `uv sync`.
